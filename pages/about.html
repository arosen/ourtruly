	<p>OursTruly was born out of the dreams of two Internet kids who wanted an easier way to connect. One day, we had to send a letter, and being the technocitizens we are, that turned out to be harder than expected. Between going to find stationary we liked (had to buy 20 pieces to send one), buying stamp, finding a nice pen, writing the thing, and roaming around trying to find a mailbox, the whole affair took a couple of hours of work.
	</p>
	<p> After collapsing onto the couch with tired feet and hand cramps that evening, OursTruly was born. We may like the speed of emails or e-cards, but sometimes the situation calls for a handwritten letter. And, face it, computers have made us a little lazy and our handwriting a little more, well, haphazard. OursTruly lets you connect to the ones you care about with a handwritten note but without all the trekking around town and messy scribe. Let our handwriting ninjas do it for you and use that two hours to do something like sit in a park.
